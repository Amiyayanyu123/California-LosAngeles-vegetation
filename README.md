# Drought-vulnerable vegetation increases exposure of disadvantaged populations to heatwaves under global warming: A case study from Los Angeles
# DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104488
Main Findings: Economically disadvantaged areas with higher proportions of Hispanics and Blacks are typified by vegetation more sensitive to drought, 
which is likely linked to inequality in water use. Moreover, these populations experience a lower degree of vegetation cooling effects and higher exposure to heatwaves.
